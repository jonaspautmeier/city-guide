This repository was created for the Version Control Course at University Hamburg. We create a city-guide for Hamburg and Rotterdam.

You can find the city guide for Hamburg and Rotterdam in the city-guide folder as a quarto file with a YAML header. If you click on render, the website opens. 

There is also a gitignore file to store unnecessary files.
